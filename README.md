# Introduction
This repository contains the codes for VRDL Homework 1, where a 100-class species classification model is built using ResNet as the backbone. The model is designed to classify images into 100 different species categories, utilizing the power of ResNetâ€™s deep learning architecture for feature extraction. The experiments conducted focus on evaluating different modifications and techniques to improve classification performance.  
ResNeXt_50_CBAM.py: ResNeXt50(32x4d) with CBAM  
ResNeXt_50_CBAM_Res2Net.py: ResNeXt50 with CBAM + Res2Net (4 splits + group=8)
