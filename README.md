# Introduction
This repository contains the codes for VRDL Homework 1, where a 100-class species classification model is built using ResNet as the backbone. The model is designed to classify images into 100 different species categories, utilizing the power of ResNetâ€™s deep learning architecture for feature extraction. The experiments conducted focus on evaluating different modifications and techniques to improve classification performance.
